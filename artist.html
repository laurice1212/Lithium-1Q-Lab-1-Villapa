            ENHYPEN is a South Korean boy band formed by BELIFT LAB, a joint venture between CJ ENM and HYBE Corporation. <br>
            The group consists of seven members: Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Ni-ki. <br>
            They were formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-LAND and debuted on November 30, 2020 with the mini album "Border : Day One". <br>
            The group's name, ENHYPEN, signifies their desire to connect, discover, and grow together, much like how a hyphen connects different words. <br>
            They are known for their dynamic and highly synchronized performances, earning them the titles of "4th Generation Hot Icons" and "Global K-pop Rising Stars". <br>
